# SwiftThreeWayRadixQuicksort
An implementation of Three-way Radix Quicksort in Swift for sorting Strings efficiently.

This is based on Section 5.1 page 719 "Three-way string quicksort" of Algorithms 4th Edition by Sedgewick and Wayne. Their Java implementation, which this is a port of, is available here:
